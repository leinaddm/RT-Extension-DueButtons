NAME
    RT-Extension-DueButtons - shortcut buttons to quickly set due dates for
    ticket

DESCRIPTION
    After installing this extension, on the ticket's page, you should see
    new buttons to set the ticket due date.

    The +1d, +2d, +3d, +1w, +1m buttons will advance the current due date
    for the ticket by the corresponding time amount. If the due date is not
    set at the moment, they will assume today's date as the base for the
    advancement.

    The tomorrow, next monday and reset buttons will set the due date to
    tomorrow, next monday or reset it respectively.

    All buttons except for the reset one will also set the ticket status to
    Stalled. The reset button does not change the ticket status.
